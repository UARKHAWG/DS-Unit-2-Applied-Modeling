# Module 1 Defining Machine Learning Problems

  * Looking at the distribution of the target and its suitability for modeling; if the classes are balanced, the appropriate type of encoding to use, and how that choice might affect the model.
  * Look at each data set you come across and think about what the target variable would be
  * Avoid leakage of information from test to train or from target to features
  * Choose an appropriate evaluation metric
      * Don’t use regression metrics to evaluate classification tasks.
